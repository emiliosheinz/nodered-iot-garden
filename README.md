# ðŸŒ± IoT Garden

This Node-RED code repository encapsulates the culmination of my Computer Science Degree projectâ€”an IoT Garden simulation. Step into the world of community gardening, reimagined through IoT technology. Explore the Node-RED flows and configurations that power this virtual green oasis, showcasing how IoT devices can be harnessed to control, monitor, and optimize a communal garden. Dive into the codebase to gain insights into the intersection of IoT and sustainable agriculture, and discover how technology can transform our connection with the natural world.
